For teachers kids and parents who like Python coding. The Python Pygame library is a powerful tool to create
animation projects with external images (downloaded from the Internet or drawn by the children themselves) 
specified in the script code. Below it is shown an example of such a game scenario: several rabbits jump across
the field, and Ðµagle hunting rabbits. Noticing a rabit, the eagle falls down, grabs and eats it. You can control 
the eagle fall with a button of the computer keyboard. Game is over when the last rabbit disappeared. Creating this 
small code (a little more than 100 lines) gives a significant impetus to the development of logical thinking. 
It is very important that we create a code that reflects real scenario, and this is more interesting for kids 
(in comparison with an abstract task). Files for modeling this scenario can be downloaded for free at:
